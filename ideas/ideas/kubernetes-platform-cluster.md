# Kubernetes Platform Cluster

Kubernetes enables easy maintenance of individual components through the creation of clusters, manages uptime in an efficient manner through the creation of pods and manages scaling by creating new pod instances when required. The Kubernetes cluster for the platform would be composed of:

1. An Openx instance
2. An Opensolar instance
3. A teller instance
4. A web interface
5. A builds instance

Each cluster can be created and deployed through config files, and these config files can be made open source so others can easily replicate this functionality.
