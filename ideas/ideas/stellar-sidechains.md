# Stellar sidechains

There are ideas for Sidechain implementations in Stellar based on ZkVM and other architectures. Having sidechains 

1. Helps offload transactions and state updates to the sidechain
2. Helps improve performance
3. Reduces fee impact of the platform

This is similar to Bitcoin sidechains described in the "Alternate Ideas" section.
