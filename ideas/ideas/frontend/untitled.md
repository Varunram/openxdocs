# Project Map

A map which displays listings on Opensolar all over the globe is a great feature to showcase on the landing page of the platform. The UI could be imagined similar to Booking.com or Google Hotels where each project has an identifier \(could be minimum investment, potential impact, rating of investment, etc\).

A map helps people quickly navigate to a location of their choice and make faster investment decisions since the quick view option shows them details of the project they are interested in.
