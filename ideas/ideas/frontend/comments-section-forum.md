# Comments section / Forum

Having a comments section on a project's page similar to Kickstarter's comments section is useful for investors to ask questions directly to the receiver. All comments are public, so peopel who have questions can go through the comments section to see if their query has been addressed.

An alternate approach is to have a forum for all things related to openx/solar covering all aspects of the platforms. The forum would require a common login with opensolar to import details like name, projects, etc.

Both approaches would need moderators to police content being posted and remove comments that are inappropriate or irrelevant. This could be done by community members appointed as mods or by admins of opensolar.
