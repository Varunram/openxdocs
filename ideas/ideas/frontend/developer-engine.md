# Developer Engine

The developer engine is a core piece of openx's infrastructure. The DE enables entities to define various parameters for a project, and get feedback from the receivers through the platform. The DE will be responsible for:

1. **Originators** creating projects in stage 0
2. **Contractors** bidding for projects in stage 2
3. **Developers** installing the project in stage 5

The developer engine can be thought of as an editable web interface that would perform a set of defined functions. It bears close parallels and would eventually communicate with the CMS system described in the "Content Management System" section.

The developer engine should closely work with the backend to communicate project requirements, and should have a clean interface that enables developers to communicate their needs and suggestions.
