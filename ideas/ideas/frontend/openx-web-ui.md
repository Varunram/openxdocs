# Openx Web UI

Openx does not have a web interface of its own. Having one would make operating openx accounts much easier and more efficient. Users can be presented with the number of platforms they are logged in, the number of platforms on which they have invested and more information.

An openx web UI would also enable the easy construction of a cross openx OAuth login
