# Improved Company Account Handling

In the current architecture, a user's public key is shared with the company they represent. Different companies associated with different entiites \(investors, recipient, entities, etc\) should have the ability to have their own public keys and process hteir own funds.

Another improvement to this would be in-platform access control where company representatives can invite others to handle specific parts of the platform. This would require the building of an in-platform interface for access control \(which could probably be done when doing the CMS\).
