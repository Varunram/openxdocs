# Project Updates Section

The project details page right now is quite static with little information apart from the stage and amoun raised being updated after the project has completed funding. A section titled "Project Updates" where the receiver updates investors on the status of the project, how things are progressing, etc on a weekly basis would be nice to have for investors to know that the project is progressing as expected.

Project Updates combined with Project Goals could be very informative for investors to study the progress of a project. It is also useful to display this in hindsight to potential recipients to show how the platform works.
