# 2FA Login

The backend has provisions for Google-2FA based login but the frontend does not have the required screen and API integration yet. Investments should not be allowed until investors have setup their 2FA credentials to prevent claims of loss of funds, fraudulent investments, etc.

2FA can also be used in place of the seed password if the user desires so and the screens for seed password confirmation need to be altered to provide for this.
