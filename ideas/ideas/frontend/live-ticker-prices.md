# Live ticker prices

Before investing, users will most certainly check the prices of the currency they are investing in. Having a ticker list from all major exchanges reduces clicks for the user and reduces potential for mistakes \(viewing coinbse.com which may have malicious prices instead of coinbase.com\).

A ticker can also be present on the recipient and developer dashboard so they can know how much their deposits and payments are worth.
