# Auction Dashboard

Currently, the following types of auctions are supported on the backend:

1. Blind
2. Vickrey
3. English
4. Dutch

A recipient can choose from any one of the above criteria towards choosing a final project from a stage 2 \(contractor proposed\) project. The frontend must have a screen that calls the relevant backend handlers and accompleishes this.
