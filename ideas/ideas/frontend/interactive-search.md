# Interactive Search

The platform currently does not have search functionality. This makes it difficult for investors to find projects they are interested in without having to scroll through all projects on the explore page. An intereactive search similar to Airbnb/Booking.com with the following functionality:

1. Search by name
2. Search by location
3. Search by project type
4. Search by entity name

would be extremely useful for investors looking through projects on the platform.
