# Inbuilt REC / Switch Integration

Currently, users have to navigate to a different portal to be able to view their RECs. Calling Swytch's APIs or by  having an ifram on Opensolar which links to Swytch can help make the UX of interacting with RECs better.

Another approach is to fork Swytch or create an in-house REC that is automatically credited to receivers based on Teller data.
