# Public Pages for Entities

When an investors looks to invest in a project, they would ideally explore mulitple facotrs before putting in their money. A part of this includes background checks on the receivers and developers, and public pages might help with that.

Public pages for entities can be thought of similar to Facebook's profile page where an entity can describe themselves, add pictures of the themselves and the project, etc. This enables investors to better judge the platform's viability and the receiver's potential to pay back towards a project. It also reduces the probability of fake projects on the platform since investors would be vary of investing in projects that do not have a public page for the receiver.

The public page could support a variety of features like adding images, videos, text descriptions ,etc. It is important to note that we don't want to enable social media features like likes since the public page is meant to be purely informative.

Public pages can also be linked on other websites \(like facebook / twitter\) and clicking on these would redirect to the openx/solar profile of the entity. This feature could even be expanded to projects.
