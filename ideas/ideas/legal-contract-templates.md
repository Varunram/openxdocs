# Legal contract templates

Projects on Opensolar require legal contracts to be signed between different entities like the receiver and developer, the investor and the platform, etc. These contracts are stored on IPFS, and their hashes are stored in the "Stage Data" field associated with each stage. Having templates for legal contracts on the frontend \(eg. a docusign iframe\) makes this process easier, and the platform can store relevant data without much user intervention. It would also enable faster processing of documents, and legal entities can register on the platform and provide these services directly. Having a central repo of contract templates also enables other platforms to borrow and adapt these to their application, saving them time and money associated with the legal process.
