# Sidechain implementations on Stellar

There are ideas for Sidechain implementations in Stellar based on ZkVM and other architectures. Having sidechains helps offload transactions and state updates to the sidechain and would improve performance and fee impact of the platform. This is similar to Bitcoin sidechains described in the "Alternatives to Stellar" section.
