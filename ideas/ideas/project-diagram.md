# Project diagram

The project diagram on the opensolar readme is outdated and does not reflect many changes that have taken place wrt platform architecture through the course of the past year. An updated diagram should reflect the different entities on the platform, different stages associated, how opensolar and openx interact in different places, how stablecoins play a part in the system, and how the project fits within the broader category of open finance. Having a diagram makes it easy for users to understand the structure of Opensolar and Openx, and helps visitors better understand the utility of the platform. It also helps display what the project intends to do in a visual form, making presentationd and explanation easier.
