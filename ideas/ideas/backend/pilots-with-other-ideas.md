# Pilots with other ideas

Currently, Opensolar is targeted at solar energy projects but an alternate implementation with fractional housing, or peer to peer loans helps expand the horizons of openx, and helps tests the utility openx provides for next generation investments. Opensolar used to house a fractional owenrship Proof of Concept in the repo before but that has now been abandoned due to a lack of progress. Potential applications that could be run as pilots include:

#### Decentralised community infrastructure

1. Water
2. Housing
3. Transport
4. Power
5. Waste

#### Climate finance

1. Forest-based project
2. Regenerative agriculture
3. Energy efficiency programs
4. Adaptation infrastructure
5. Biogas
