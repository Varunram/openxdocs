# Virtual dev sandbox

Currently, we have a sandbox on the backend that can be customised and run be people who want to test and run Openx/solar.   Having a virtual sandbox \(similar to some courses where there's a terminal on the right and there's text on the left\) would be immsenself useful for people to easily visualise  how openx and opensolar interact, and also enable people to readily test out features that they wish to implement.  
  
This would ideally require that a client side terminal be run on the website somehow. Katakoda \([https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-interactive/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-interactive/)\) is a good example and can be imported for what we seek to accomplish.
