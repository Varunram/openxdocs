# Corporate CSR mode

CSR arms of companies must be able to invest in groups of projects as quickly and efficiently as possible. The backend can have a simplified workflow for these companies \(they would have to fulfil KYC / AML regulations however\) where investing is easily enabled and access control is tuned towards the internal structure of the CSR arm.
