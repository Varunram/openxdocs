# Fiat support

Supporting Fiat Currencies \(USD, EUR, etc\) on the platform can greatly help increae the number of people who would like to be part of the platform. Fiat support through Stripe or PayPal should be relatively easy through their APIs although they may require documentation to support the platform's use case and viability.

A project can choose to accept fiat funding or the platform could enable it by default. When investing in the project, the platform could ask for the investor's preference on the confirmation page or on the starting page \(where balances are displayed\). If there are excanges interate wth opensolar, the platform could use the exchange's APIs to switch between muiltiple currencies and have only one base currency.
