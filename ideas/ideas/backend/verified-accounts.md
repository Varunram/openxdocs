# Verified accounts

Verified accounts \(similar to "blue check accounts" on twitter\) are accounts whose credentials are verified and they are presented with a badge that shows that their account has been verified. This helps prevent bots, spam users, etc whoi might impersonate others and try to steal money from entities on the platform.

Verified accounts  can also be used in the context of companies whose KYC information has been verified \(eg. Coca Cola could have a tick if their company's representative uploaded the necessary docs to prove that they really are from Coca Cola\).
