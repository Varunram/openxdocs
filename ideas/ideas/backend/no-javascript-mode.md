# No Javascript mode

Javascript has a set of vulnerabilities that some users are wary of, and as a result use a no-js environment to avoid scripts being run in the browser. Having somethign similar in openx/solar would involve the creation of a pre-compilation step which compiles the javascript on the web interface and serves it directly to the user.
