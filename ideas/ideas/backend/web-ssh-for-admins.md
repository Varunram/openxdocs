# Web SSH for admins

Right now, admins can access the openx server only by having access to aws root credentials. In the future, admins might want to view debug logs, change modes, or perform emergency backup and it is easier to provide a web SSH UI with limited functionality to achieve this.

A web SSH UI would also enable real time logs on the admin dashboard which is extremely useful to monitor investments, thwart attackers, etc. It also helps non devops admins handle and report emergencies easier.
