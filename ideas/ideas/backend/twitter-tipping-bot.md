# Twitter Tipping Bot

Similar to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash tipping bots, there could be an opensolar tipping bot which can enable investments in projects with minimal effort. This would be an interesting side project and in the future can be extended into an external plugin for websites which can request for donations through opensolar.

The both could also offer additional features like viewing the status of a project, listing all projects, etc through twitter's Direct Message \(DMs\) which would help bring non tech uses onboard the platform.

The tipping bot could theoretically accept investments in any currency with a minmum investment amount and exchange the received amount for a project's native currency through an exchange's APIs
