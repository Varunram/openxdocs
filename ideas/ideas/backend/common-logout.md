# Common logout

Openx accounts, by their design, can be used on multiple platforms. When using on multiple platforms however, the risk of hacks or misues are amplified and it owuld make sense to have a "logout from all devices" feature \(similar to Netflix\) which allows the user to invalidate all openx tokens with a single click.

Ideally, this should be implemented after multiple tokens are implemented \(else, it would require a rewrite after that feature is implemented\).
