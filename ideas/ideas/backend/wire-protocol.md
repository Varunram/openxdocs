# Wire protocol

Currently, platforms communicate with each other through SSL/TLS. The creation of a wire protocol that can accomplish this would be very useful since it would improve speed of communication and enable the creation of CLI clients using which platforms can interact with each other.

An example of this can be viewed in the Lightning Network Protocol where peers talk with each other using the Noise protocol.
