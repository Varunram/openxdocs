# Dynamic Stage definitions

Currently, Opensolar hosts stages that are fixed and cannot be changed by receivers or other entities if they wish to do so. Having dynamic stages \(eg, a project can choose to have only 3 stages\) gives more flexibility to the receiver to define stages associated with their project.

This would also involve changes to the `StageData` field, which would become dynamic in order to support the stages defined by the receiver.
