# End project state

Currently, projects on Opensolar do not have an end state but it is necessary to retire projects once they reach stage 8/9 and display relevant data to investors and recipients on their dashboards. This would help keep track of how many projects have been completed and these projects could be displayed in a separate screen similar to the Explore Screen.

An extension of this would be handling the hand-off event where the ownership of the solar system changes from investors to the recipient. This handoff event could include the signing of a legal contract template which requires signatures. The document once signed will be stored on IPFS and the recipient can use it as proof of ownership in a legal context. Alternatively, end project states could be triggered by platform admins and notifications can be sent to all project entities.

UPDATE \(6/1/19\): An end project state had been created, admins can now set a project to complete or not complete through the admin dashboard interface. The integration around transfer of assets to the recipient still remains, and the admin dashboard does not have a web interface design yet.
