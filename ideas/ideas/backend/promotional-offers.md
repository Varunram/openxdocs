# Promotional Offers

In order to get more people interested in investing, the platform can provide a set of incentives like promotional offers and referral codes which provide bonuses or discounts on investment in projects on the platform. The goal of these should be to get more entities participating in projects on the platform and not at just getting more signups or user registrations.

These promos could be targeted at a single platform like opensolar or towards all projects on openx. Ideally, admins must be able to generate these codes from the admin dashboard, and monitor response from the same interface.
