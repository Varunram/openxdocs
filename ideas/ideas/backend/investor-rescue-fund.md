# Investor rescue fund

BitMEX has a "rescue fund" which it uses to refund investor on the platform in case there's a hack or htings go wrong on the platform. Openx/solar could have something similar as well to protect investors, recipients and all other entities involved. Funds to this account would be accumulated through extra fees whose proceeds go directly to the investor rescue fund.
