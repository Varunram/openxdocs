# Investment Tiers

Having investment tiers like Gold, Silver, Bronze, Institutional, etc helps investors easily navigate to their desired projects based on the scale and amount of risk that they desire to be associated with their investment. Investment tiers could also be displayed as badges on an investor's profile so receivers know what kind of investments they are getting towards their projects and can engage with them more effectively.
