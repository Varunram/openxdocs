# Real Time Oracles

Currently, we make use of a static oracle that fetches the price of elctricity in Puerto Rico from the backend. We could have a dynamic oracle which fetches the electricity price in real time and feeds it to the frontend. This would work closely with the ability for neighbours to report electricity price in the area which would then be averaged to find the electricity price for the installed project.
