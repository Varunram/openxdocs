# Multiple Tellers

Having multiple tellers is a powerful primitive to be able to accurately keep track of the energy generated, and the amount to be paid back to investors. There could be different tiers of Tellers:

1. Monitoring Teller run by the platform
2. Reporting Teller run on the IoT device
3. Watchdog Teller run on a third server, connected to the IoT device and the monitor

This could prevent malpractice on the receivers' end and on the platform's end since the data stream is no longer singular. This could also reduce the lead time of deploying fixes to the Teller since two pieces in the above flow \(monitoring and watchdog\) can be updated as soon as stable updates are available.
