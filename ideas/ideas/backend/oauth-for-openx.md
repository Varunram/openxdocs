# OAuth for Openx

OAuth is a standard protocol used for login by Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc that makes cross site login and integration easier. For openx, that would mean cross openx-platform registration is as simple as generating an OAuth token and adding a button that says "Login with openx". This button is similar to "Login with Facebook" and can be placed on any website as long as there's a token associated with the button.
