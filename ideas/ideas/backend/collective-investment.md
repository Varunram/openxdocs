# Collective Investment

A group of investments similar to an ETF or a set of mutual funds in the traditional finance world is useful to balance risk and investment return. For opensolar, that would mean balancing between different energy types, locations and returns. The platform can curate a collection of projects based on defined parameters and offer them to investors who would like to invest directly without diving deep into individual projects. This is also simple for companies which would like to manage a comprehensive portfolio of clean energy projects while balancing risk and returns.

This also blends in well with CSR initiatives since CSR heads can simply navigage to openx and invest in a specific collection.
