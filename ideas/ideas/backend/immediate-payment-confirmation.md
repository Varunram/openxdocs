# Immediate Payment Confirmation

When using Walmart, the checkout process is very fast - you enter your CC/DC details and right away, you're taken to the payment confirmation screen. The actual payment doesn't happen until about 2 hours later, failing which the order stands as not confirmed and an email is sent to the buyer.

A similar workflow could be done in opensolar where investments are confirmed immediately \(while the blockchain processes occur in the background\) and users are sent emails if their investments didn't go through. This avoids the need to wait on a particular screen for confirmation \(which currently takes about 30s\).
