# In Platform Notifications

Currently, notifications are sent via emai lto entities involved in a project. An improvement to this would be if we can have notifications inside the platform \(probably a different section\) where the entity can view a list of the notifications that they have received.

Having in-platform notifications also makes it easier to send messages and create custom prompts \(like "Enter your seed password to accept your investment"\) which would otherwise be tough while sending notifications through email.
