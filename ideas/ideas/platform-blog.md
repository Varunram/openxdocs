# Platform Blog

The platform could have a daily / weekly / monthly blog where admins post on a wide range of topics. The blog could feature experiences by entities, projects that reached completion, projects that are new to the platform, etc. It could also have sections within it \(technical section, news section, etc\) and each section can have its own cycle of updates.

Having a blog helps icnrease the reach of the platform beyond entities interested in participating. It also keeps activity around the platform active, and builds a community around the project.
