# Emulator upgrades

The emulator emulates certain functionality of the platform but does not act as a complete replacement to the web interface. The emulator is useful to test functionality of the backend that is not yet present on the frontend. This should be expanded to include the full functions of the backend so users who don't want to trust a web interface or users who don't want to wait for features to be implement on the frontend can still interact and perform functions within the platform.
