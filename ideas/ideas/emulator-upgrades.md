# Emulator upgrades

The emulator emulates certain functionality of the backend but does not act as a complete replacement to the web interface. The emulator is useful to test functionality of the backend that is not yet present on the frontend. This should be expanded to include the full functions of the backend so users who don't want to trust a web interface or users who don't want to wait for features to be implement on the frontend can still interact and perform functions within the platform.

The emulator could also be combined with the teller to offer a singular interface for people to interact with opensolar through the CLI. This would enable recipients to access a broader set of features than the Teller, and enable investors to monitor the teller directly though their CLI.

The emulator could also be packaged as an Electron app and run as a standalone web interface. Alternately, the web interface could be packaged as an Electron App and offered to users who wish to run their own web interface.
