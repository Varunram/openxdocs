# Create an end project state

Currently, projects on Opensolar do not have an end state but it is required to retire projects once they reach stage 8/9 and display relevant data to investors and recipients on their dashboards. This would help keep track of how many projects have been completed and these projects could be displayed in a separate screen similar to the Explore Screen. An extension of this would be handling the hand-off event where the ownership of the solar system changes from the investors to the recipient. This process can be part of the platform, requiring signatures on DocuSign within an iframe. End project states could also be trigerred by the platform admin and notifications can be sent to all project entities.
