# Quadratic Funding

Quadratic Funding is a new donation model popularised by Glen Weyl and Gitcoin. It proposes a quadratic matching scheme as opposed to a linear scheme to avoid gaming of the system and gives more emphasis to smaller donations.

Quadratic Funding would be a nice model to have for donation projects and for investors looking to match donations towards specific projects. Integration with Gitcoin can also be part of this, presenting further interesting applications.
