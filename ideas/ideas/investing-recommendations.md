# Investing Recommendations

Kickstarter routinely sends out marketing emails containing information like "Projects that you may find interesting", "Projects based on your funding history", etc. This would be nice to have for opensolar either as emails, or as notifications built into the platform since this would drive investors to checkout new projects. Recipients also get more direct exposure since the emails / notifications reach investors directly.
