# Entity Leaderboard

The platform could have a leaderboard where the investors that have invested the most are ranked in descending order. A similar leaderboard could be in place for recipients who can be ranked based on their rating or their number of completed projects.

The leaderboard can be further divided into classes \(Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc\) and this class can be displayed on the profile page of an entity. More awards like "Investor of the month" and similar can be added as necessary.
