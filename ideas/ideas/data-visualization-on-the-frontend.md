# Data visualization on the frontend

Though multiple data points are available for a project, data is still displayed as text on the web interface. Having interactive graphs and charts enhances the presentation of projects, and helps investors and receivers better understand the status of a project. This should also focus on the teller dashboard since most of the data from the teller is statistical and might be difficult to grasp for a receiver. The investor dashboard should have graphs related to the net returns, net amount invested in projects, etc. The developer dashboard could have information on the status of the teller, the energy generated and have provisions to download detailed logs.
