Opensolar is built on Stellar currently but there are proposals for building Opensolar on an alternate blockchain ecosystem. This can be done in parallel to Opensolar as is to compare both platforms simultaneously. More details and ideas for these are outlined in the "Alternatives to Stellar" section of the wiki.
