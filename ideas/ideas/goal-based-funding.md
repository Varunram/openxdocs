# Goal based funding

Platforms like Kickstarter have goal based funding schemes ie a receiver can define a set of funding goals and each goal has a set of benefits. For opensolar, the first goal could be installing a 1MW panel, the second could be installing a 5MW panel, etc. Each goal has benefits associated with it, and investors would receive returns based on the goal stage they invested in.

This would require a modification to the way stages are presented right now to invlude support for goals, and would also require the addition of several UI components to display the goals and the number of investors at each goal stage.
