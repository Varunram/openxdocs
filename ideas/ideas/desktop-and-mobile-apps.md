# Desktop and Mobile Apps

Opensolar can have desktop and mobile apps that communicate with the backend and serve critical functions like checking balance, monitoring paybacks, investing in projects. These apps reduce trust placed in the web interface since they are user run. It also helps expand the user base of the platform since entities are no longer required to use the web interface. Mobile Apps open up potential for mobile device notifications which can be used to alert receivers to add stablecoin to their account, alert investors on their investment, etc.
