# Featured Projects

Currently, there is only one kind of project on the platform. There are two ideas linked to featured platforms:

1. Featured platforms are static and can be projects that are hosted at the DCI, projects that pay for the featured platform tag, etc
2. Featured platforms can change daily \(similar to "Quote of the Day" on quote websites\). These platforms would be curated by a list of content admins.

Featuring projects helps increase the amount of investment they receive and can generate more goodwill / advertisement for the project.
