# One Click Invest

Platforms like Amazon have a "One click" checkout feature which navigates users directly to the final confirmation page without displaying the steps in between. This makes use of a combination of default payment methods, shipping addresses, etc in order to not prompt the user to fill in these details.

One click invest is useful for returning investors who've already vetted the project, and are back just to invest in the project. It is also useful for people who want to invest small amounts in projects and don't want to worry about vetting projects. This can help in donation projects where people can just display the one click invest link and ask for donations.
