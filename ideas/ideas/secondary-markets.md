# Secondary markets

The platform can make use of the Stellar DEX to offer a secondary market to investors who can exchange one type of project assets for the other. Secondary markets can enable the exchange of one project's INVAsset for another, and one project's DebtAsset for another. This greatly helps an investor balance their portfolio with a collection of safe projects and risky projects. Recipients could also potentially transfer DebtAssets to other asset holders or even a bank in exchange for short term collateral. This would help bring in investors who couldn't invest when the project was in a stage for investment but want to do so later. Investors wanting to exit Opensolar can easily do so by selling their INVAssets to other investors.
