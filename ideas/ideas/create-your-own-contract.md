# Create your own contract

Right now, the platform uses a predefined smart contract with the project threshold as the only changeable parameter. Having a web based interface for originators and receivers to tweak other parameters and create their own smart contract enables them to come up with new ideas that existing contract creators may not encounter, and ideas that are exclusive to the project they are requesting funding for. This greatly aids the expansion from solar energy projects to other types of investments since people can define their own conditions. It also helps gives people flexibility while designing various parts of the contract like payback period, investment models and more. Some part of the contract however would be fixed and editable only on the backend or by project admins.
