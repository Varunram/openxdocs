# Run own stellar core and horizon instances

Opensolar currently uses services run by the Stellar Development Foundation for interacting with the blockchain. The platform running its own core and horizon instances reduces dependency on the SDF, and might help handle transaction relay problems with SDF's horizon API. This however, doesn't solve problems with the consensus protocol that make Stellar centralised, which is explained in detail in the "Alternate Ideas" section.
