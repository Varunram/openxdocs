# Investments using other assets

Currently, the platform can only do stablecoin investments in projects. Having XLM investments in projects is easy if the project's threshold is in XLM. Investing using other assets on Stellar is also useful in expanding the reach of the platform.

Assets can be exchanged for stablecoin / the native asset of the project on the Stellar DEX in real time to simplify internal handling. When withdrawing, the investor can specify the asset they want and the platform can once again exchange the native asset for the desired asset. Having an internal matching engine makes this process easier.
