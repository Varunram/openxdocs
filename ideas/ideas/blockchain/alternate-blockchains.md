Opensolar is currently built on Stellar but there are proposals for building Opensolar on an alternate blockchain ecosystem. This can be done in parallel to Opensolar in order to compare both platforms and arrive at a list of advantages and disadvantages. More details and ideas for these are outlined in the "Alternate Ideas" section.
