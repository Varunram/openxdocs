# Hardware Wallet Support

Currently, Stellar seeds are encrypted with the seed password and stored on a database on the paltform's backend. Having hardware wallet integration would mean that users who manage their own keys \(ie users who are more security conscious\) can invest in projects on opensolar if they have a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger.

If a user chooses to connect their hw wallet, we should not import their seed onto the platform - rather the flow must be in such a way that the ycan invest one time and there's no seed interaction with the platform after that. This would blend in nicely with the emulator CLI and could borrow certain upgrades from there.
