# Scheduled Investments

Companies with a good CSR policy are looking to constantly invest a fixed amount of money in projects. Having scheduled investments where such companies can invest year after year is good for the platform to gain mroe traction in the commercial space.

Companies would be required to specify a list of characteristics based on which the scheduled investments will be selected. These can be energy type \(solar, wind, etc\), location, risk factor, desired returns, and much more.
