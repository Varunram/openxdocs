# Manual smart contracts

Contrary to pausable smart contracts, a manually trigerred smart contract is when a platform admin can immediately move a project to stage 4 for investment, or to stage 5 after post-investment to start the teller workflow, etc. This is useful in cases when automatic flow breaks or is not necessary since the platform admins have already approved the stage transition earlier.

It also helps in cases when the receiver defaults on payments, and the investors together decide to change the terms of investment. For stage transitions like stage 7-8, admins can review stage data and transition stages manually since there is no end project state defined for a project.

Manual smart contracts are extremely useful in combination with pausable smart contracts since they provide power to platform admins to regulate the functioning of the platform. These functions could also be used by an enforcement agency like the SEC.
