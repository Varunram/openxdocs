# P2P Matching Engine

The platform should have an internal matching engine which can match investors who are investing and recipients/ developers who wish to withdraw funds from the platform. This avoids the need for either side to wait for AnchorUSD to process deposits and withdrawals. An internal matching engine would work closely with an in house DEX to process orders.

A matching engine also provides for interesting possibilities on investments \(a person willing to sell their investment can be matched with a person willing to buy directly\) and recipients \(a recipient wishing for investment in a project can ask previous investors or investors in other projects and match directly\).
