# P2P Matching Engine

We should build an internal matching engine which can match investors who are investing and recipients/ developers who wish to withdraw funds from the platform. This avoids the need for either side to wait for AnchorUSD to process deposits and withdrawals. An internal matching engine would work closely with an in house DEX to process orders.
