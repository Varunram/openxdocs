# Private investments

Some investors might not want to reveal their investment amounts, or sometimes even their public keys. To obscure investment amounts, an idea is to transact multiple times between the investor and platform, and the net sum of all these transactions would be the investor's investment in the project. To obscure their public key, they could use transfer funds to the project indirectly, transfer to a one time address possessed by the platform, and link paybacks to a new address they control. This would obscure the trail between an investor and the platform.
