# Private investments

Some investors might not want to reveal their investment amounts, or sometimes even their public keys. To obscure investment amounts, one idea is to transact multiple times between the investor and platform, and the net sum of all these transactions would be the investor's investment in the project. To obscure their public key, they could transfer funds to the project indirectly or transfer to a one time address possessed by the platform and link paybacks to a new address they control. This would obscure the trail between an investor and the platform.

Other ideas are using ZCash and other privacy focused coins for project investment. This would involve enabling investments in two currencies in one contract.
