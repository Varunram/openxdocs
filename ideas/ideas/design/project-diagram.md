# Project diagram

The project diagram on the opensolar readme is outdated and does not reflect changes in platform architecture through the course of the past year. An updated diagram should reflect the different entities on the platform, different stages associated, how opensolar and openx interact, how stablecoins play a part in the system, and how the project fits within the broader category of open finance.

Having a diagram makes it easy for users to understand the structure of Opensolar and Openx, and helps visitors better understand the utility of the platform. It also helps display what the project intends to do in a visual form, making presentationd and explanation easier.

This should ideally be done in design software like Sketch, and the sketch files must be added to the docs section of the openx/opensolar repositories. Making the design file open source enables others to easily edit and adapt the project diagram to their requirements.
