### Introduction

Opensolar is a platform for investments in solar energy projects. Opensolar's initial prototype was in Ethereum, and currently uses the Stellar blockchain. In this document, we will explore key advantages and disadvantages of using Stellar, along with other alternative blockchain ecosystems that Opensolar could potentially use.

### Goals

The platform has a set of goals which can be used to compare different blockchain ecosystems:

* **Trustless:** The platform must minimize trust in itself to avoid attack vectors centred around it.
* **Secure and Decentralised:** The platform must be backed by a secure blockchain without the possibility of attacks either by a coordinated hash power or by a small group of attackers.
* **Robust in functions:** The platform must be able to perform its intended set of functions in an easy, fast and secure manner without compromising on provided functions.
* **Good partner ecosystem:** Users must be able to get on the platform as easily as possible with minimal steps required.

For more ideas, checkout the "Alternate Ideas" section.

In the "Alternate Ideas" section, contentious blockchains like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV whose development is highly volatile and centralised to a limited number of people in the ecosystem are omitted. Blockchains like Tron, Ripple, and EOS whose development and funding goals aren't clearly defined are also omitted.
