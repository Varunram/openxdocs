# Advantages

1. **More decentralised than Ethereum-L1**: The barrier of entry to a DAO is low and as a result, people can easily participate in DAOs. This means more people partake in governance resulting in a better platform.
2. **More participation functionality:** Since a DAO enables new forms of participation, the platform could expand on governance related functions.
