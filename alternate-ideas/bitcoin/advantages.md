# Advantages

1. **Good security and decentralisation:** Due to Bitcoin's PoW consensus model, it is extremely expensive for an attacker to attempt to censor or rewrite transactions. Bitcoin also has a large number of nodes \(&gt;10000\) which improves decentralisation.
2. **Big partner ecosystem:** Bitcoin has a large number of partner companies looking to improve different aspects of using and getting on to Bitcoin.
3. **Improved functionality:** Bitcoin has more opcodes than Stellar, and the platform can implement more complex functionality.
4. **Good Liquidity:** Bitcoin is the most traded cryptocurrency asset. Hence liquidity on popular markets is not of concern.
5. **On chain verification:** Bitcoin Script is verified on chain, and the platform need not be trusted for performing correct computation.
