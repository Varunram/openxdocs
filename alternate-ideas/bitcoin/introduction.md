# Introduction

Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency, powered by a Proof of Work consensus mechanism. Bitcoin uses an unspent transaction output \(utxo\) model and individual utxos are transferred between multiple addresses. Bitcoin possesses a native scripting language called Bitcoin Script which can be used to model different functions on Bitcoin.

Similar to how things work on Stellar, the same transactions and workflow can be mirrored on Bitcoin.
