# Disadvantages

1. **Slow confirmation time:** Bitcoin transactions are slower than Stellar transactions, so the platform needs to wait for a given period of time before it can confirm an investment or withdrawal.
2. **High Fees:** Bitcoin transaction fees vary widely, and sometimes it can be expensive to spend Bitcoin.
3. **Absence of assets:** Since Bitcoin doesn't support assets, there is no ready solution to adopt which can replace assets on Stellar. An alternative is to get rid of assets and handle only proofs.
