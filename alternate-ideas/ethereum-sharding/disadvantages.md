# Disadvantages

1. **Not time tested:** Sharding is not a new idea but implementations of sharding in the blockchain space have not been tested for security and performance.
2. **Need to handle shard commitments, updates and malicious behaviour:** There is a possibility that a participant in the platform coordinates with shard validators to defraud the platform or the platform can coordinate with validators to defraud entities. Attack scenarios need to be modelled and tested carefully before deployment.
3. **Compatibility with Beacon Chain:** It is unclear how compatible Sharding will be with the Ethereum PoS upgrade.
