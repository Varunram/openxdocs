# Advantages

1. **Low Fees:** Each shard can process transactions faster and cheaper since the shards communicate with each other only at certain intervals.
2. **Big partner ecosystem:** Ethereum has a large number of partner companies looking to improve different aspects of using and getting on to Ethereum.
3. **More secure and decentralised:** Shards are easy to run and the requirement to become a shard validator is not too high. The number of nodes running Ethereum full nodes is around 6000 and the number of shards will only be more, making it more decentralised than Stellar.
4. **Improved functionality:** Since shards replicate the functionality of Ethereum-L1, the EVM and other features are available on any shard.
5. **Faster transactions:** Transaction processing is split into multiple shards and each shard can process the same amount of transactions faster since there are more processing units to process them.
