# Advantages

1. **Improved Functionality:** Sidechains offer a wide range of functionality like smart contracts, asset and confidential transactions which can be used to improve platform functionality.
2. **Fast transactions:** Sidechain transactions are usually faster than Bitcoin-L1, and depending on construction, faster than Stellar.
3. **Easy integration with Bitcoin-L1 and Lightning:** Sidechain pegs are easy to get in and out of. Onboarding is therefore easier since one can leverage the partner ecosystem of Bitcoin to get into a sidechain.
4. **More secure decentralised than Stellar:** Sidechains usually have more running nodes than Stellar and therefore, it is less likely a transaction will be censored. Since sidechains are used in combination with Bitcoin-L1, sidechains borrow from Bitcoin-L1's security.
5. **Low fees:** Sidechains usually have negligible fees as compared to Bitcoin-L1, and sometimes, Stellar.
