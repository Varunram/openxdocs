# Disadvantages

1. **External consensus mechanism:** The sidechain may have its own consensus mechanism and the attack vectors associated with this needs to be reviewed carefully.
2. **Deposits and Withdrawal delays:** When an entity wants to withdraw funds, they need to wait for the next commitment / merge mined block on Bitcoin, and subsequent confirmations on Bitcoin in order to withdraw their funds. This is usually slow since entities wait for a certain period of time before confirming a transaction on Bitcoin.
3. **Not time tested:** Sidechains are a relatively new idea, and their security has not been as time tested as Bitcoin. Sidechains however, have not suffered attacks like Stellar.
