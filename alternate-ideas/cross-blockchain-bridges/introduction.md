# Cross Blockchain Bridges

Ethereum offers bridges to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. These bridges could be used to construct a dual layer commitment system where proofs exist in two blockchains. Bridges can also offer a choice between two chains depending on the fee, atomic swaps with other chains using the smart contract, and more.

In essence, a bridge is like having two-L1 blockchains to commit to and the trust model is dependent on the least secure of the two blockchains along with the bridge's smart contract.
