# Advantages

1. **Low Fees:** Each shard is less expensive compared to the parent blockchain.
2. **Big partner ecosystem:** Ethereum has a large number of partner companies looking to improve different aspects of using and getting on to Ethereum.
3. **More secure and decentralised:** Shards are easy to run and the requirement to become a shard validator is not high. The number of Ethereum full nodes is around 6000 and the number of shards will only be more, making it more decentralised than Stellar.
4. **Improved functionality:** Since shards replicate the functionality of Ethereum-L1, the EVM and other features are available on any shard.
5. **Faster transactions:** Transaction processing is split into multiple shards and each shard can process the same amount of transactions faster since there are more processing units.
