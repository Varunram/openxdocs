# Advantages

1. **Better security and decentralisation:** Due to Ethereum's PoW consensus model, it is extremely expensive for an attacker to attempt to censor or rewrite transactions.
2. **Big partner ecosystem:** Ethereum has a large number of partner companies looking to improve different aspects of using and getting on to Ethereum.
3. **Improved functionality:** Ethereum's EVM provides the ability to replicate any program on Ethereum thereby expanding the capabilities of the platform.
4. **Good Liquidity:** Ethereum is the second most traded cryptocurrency asset. Hence liquidity on popular markets is not of concern.
5. **On chain verification:** The EVM provides an easy mechanism to verify computation on chain.
