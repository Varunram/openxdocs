# Swytch.io

Swytch is a third party provider and partner of Opensolar that generates Renewable Energy Certificates \(RECs\) for each Megawatt of energy generated. Swytch mints RECs based on the data it receives from the IoT device through the MQTT protocol.

RECs can be sold by the recipient on secondary markets or back to investors depending on the investment contract. Swytch also provides an interactive dashboard at test.swytch-x.io where recipients can visualize the amount of energy generated throughout the day and other statistics in graph form.
