# About

## Introduction

Opensolar is a platform built using the Stellar blockchain that enables investments in solar infrastructure. Opensolar is built on openx, a broader "platform of platforms" architecture for investments in blockchains. Opensolar aims to automate the process of energy production, billing, and asset ownership for the recipient and the process of continual returns for the investor.

Opensolar is designed to be modular and each module can be used in a different application. The core platform is built on top of openx, a broader "platform of platforms" architecture that can be used for a wide range of investment types.

Investors and Receivers on the platform need to perform KYC to be able to invest and partake in projects listed on Opensolar. Developers and Contractors need to store details related to their company on the platform to get approval from investors and receivers. Guarantors need to store their details and provide sufficient proof of funding. If entities need to handle Stablecoin \(AnchorUSD\) on the platform, they must perform KYC on AnchorUSD's website.

The platform maintains an internal database built on boltDB to keep track of entity details, project details and other details that are exclusive to it.

The platform uses IoT devices for monitoring energy production and stores the data generated by these devices on IPFS. A piece of software called the teller reads data from the IoT device and triggers payment conditions on the platform.

The platform's investment and payment workflow is regulated by a smart contract run on AWS. This smart contract interfaces with the blockchain, coordinates payments between the receiver and investors, and more.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract runs on AWS since Stellar does not support on chain smart contracts. It contains core functionality surrounding investments and payback whereas auxiliary features that handle transactions like asset creation are imported from sub-packages. The smart contract also allows for different investment models which can be defined in a relevant sub package. By default, it uses the munibond model for investments.

## Investments

Investors are required to pass a series of checks before being allowed to invest in projects. These checks include KYC and AML checks \(on the platform, not AnchorUSD\), balance checks, and a ban check to see if the user has been banned on the platform. If an investor fails to meet these criteria, they can not invest in projects on the platform.

## Web Interface

The web interface of opensolar is built using React.JS and contains a subset of the functions enabled by the opensolar backend. It currently provides user profiles, projects that investors can invest in, and dashboards for recipients, investors and developers.

## RPC API

Opensolar performs all of its interactions with the web interface and teller through JSON-RPC APIs. Some endpoints are public and can be called without a token. Other endpoints are restricted, requiring an account on opensolar and a token to call them.

The token can be fetched by POSTing to `/token` with the username and the 512 byte SHA3 hash of the password. This token is valid for 24 hours but callers can generate a new token even if the timeout interval hasn't been reached.

## Solar Infrastructure

The solar infrastructure for Opensolar is composed of multiple parts - Solar Panels, IoT devices which report energy generated to an IoT Hub, and an IoT Hub which records the amount of energy generated during every interval of time defined. Opensolar interfaces with the IoT Hub to collect data on energy consumption and the IoT Hub triggers conditions defined by the smart contract. This is done by running a piece of software called the Teller on the IoT Hub.

## Teller

The teller is an executable that interfaces with the platform to constantly report progress, store energy data on the blockchain, and trigger payments every payment interval. The teller contains information about the recipient and draws funds from the recipient's account to pay back towards the smart contract. The teller also acts as a mini CLI emulator and can be used to query limited information like the amount of money left in the recipient's account and the latest state of the teller from the teller.

## MQTT Broker

The IoT devices linked to the solar panels transmit data using the MQTT protocol. The MQTT protocol requires a transmitter \(the IoT devices linked to the solar panel\), a broker to broadcast the messages received from the transmitter, and a receiver which connects to the broker and subscribes to messages from the transmitter. The broker can either be run alongside the platform or can be run on the IoT Hub depending on the energy specifications and capabilities of the IoT Hub. Opensolar runs an MQTT broker at mqtt.openx.solar which acts as the broker for projects on the platform.

## Swytch.io

Swytch.io is a third party provider that generates Renewable Energy Certificates \(RECs\) for each Megawatt of energy generated. A copy of the data sent to mqtt.openx.solar is also sent to Swytch.io to mint RECs. These RECs can be sold by the recipient or investor on secondary markets as defined in the investment contract. Swytch also provides an interactive dashboard where recipients can visualize the amount of energy generated throughout the day and other statistics in graph form.
