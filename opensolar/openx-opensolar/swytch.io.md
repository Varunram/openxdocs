# Swytch.io

Swytch is a third party provider and partner of Opensolar that generates Renewable Energy Certificates \(RECs\) for each Megawatt hour of energy generated by the solar energy system. Swytch mints RECs based on the data it receives from the IoT device. Swytch also provides a dashboard for entities to view energy generation over time and the number of RECs owned.

RECs can be sold by the recipient on secondary markets or back to investors depending on the terms defined in the investment contract. Swytch also provides an interactive dashboard at test.swytch-x.io where recipients can visualize the amount of energy generated throughout the day and other statistics in graph form.
