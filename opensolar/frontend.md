# Frontend

The web interface of opensolar is built using React.JS and contains a subset of the functions provided by the opensolar backend. It currently provides user profiles, projects that investors can invest in, and dashboards for recipients, investors and developers.

The frontend has multiple ideas \(outlined in the "Ideas" section\) that are slated for future development. These ideas aim to improve the functionality of the web interface and match those provided by the backend.
