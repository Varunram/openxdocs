# Openx-Opensolar Communication

Openx is meant to be a broader platform infrastructure which can accommodate a wide variety of platforms. Opensolar is one of the platforms which is based off openx. Platforms need to obtain a special token in order to call endpoints that are reserved for platforms. These endpoints allow a caller platform to import openx user data, user KYC data, their balances on different blockchains, and more. Communication between openx and opensolar is through the JSON-RPC APIs of openx.
