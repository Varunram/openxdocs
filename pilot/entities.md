### FabIDEAS Coop

Cooperativa FÃ¡brica de Ideas de Aibonito \(FabIDEAS Coop\), is a project that has received the support of Institute Nueva Escuela \(INE\), an independent 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the public education system in Puerto Rico through the Montessori philosophy.

FabIDEAS Coop is an initiative of the community linked to the INE public school S.U. Pasto in the rural town of Aibonito. FabIDEAS Coop aims to create an economic model in which a cooperative of Montessori materials with five initial members serves as an economic engine for the production and distribution of educational products and children furniture, where each additional member of the community that joins the production guild can learn product design and gradually increase his/her income source. It will act as a hub for education in distributed manufacturing to the students of SU Pasto and as an emergency shelter for community members.
