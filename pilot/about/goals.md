# Goals

The pilot has been designed with the following goals in mind:

1. Demonstrate contractual automation and disintermediation of renewable energy project finance using blockchain-based smart contracts
2. Demonstrate alternative finance schemes with pay-to-own models for community ownership of solar assets.
3. Demonstrate the integration between data from internet-of-things \(IoT\) devices into payment schemes and climate asset tokenisation \(Renewable Energy Certificates\).
4. Stress test all features in the OpenSolar platforms, including user experiences, fiat ramps and smart contracts.
5. Provide a blueprint for a finance plan to transform all of Puerto Ricoâ€™s public schools into solar powered emergency shelters.
