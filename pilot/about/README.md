The pilot project entails the installation of a 5kW system with InverSolâ€™s Lumen battery and inverter unit. Solar will power critical loads in the building including emergency lights, a telecommunication system, and main manufacturing equipment.

The installed system is priced at $12000, with $9000 being donated by Council Rock / InverSol to support the pilot and coop. The Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab will provide a grant of $4000 to cover $3000 of labor cost by the inverSol team and $1000 of other installation services. The FabIDEAS Coop has agreed to match this $4000 by paying for the solar electricity at the standard utility price \(which the building is subject to when it purchases power from the grid\). Once funds accrue they will be reinvested in manufacturing units for the Fab Lab.
