# Modes

Openx has two modes: Testnet and Mainnet

In testnet mode, Openx operates on the Stellar Development Foundation's Testnet. 

In mainnet mode, Openx operates on the public Stellar blockchain.

Platforms can choose which mode they wish to run on and platform admins can change this mode when the platform is running.
