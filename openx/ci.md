# CI

A basic CI that builds the openx and opensolar executables is available as part of openx. This can be modified to build any executable. There is a web interface for downloading these executables inspired by Go Downloads, providing users with a clickable interface. This CI ensures Openx platforms are able to provide cross platform builds easily.
