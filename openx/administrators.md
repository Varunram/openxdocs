# Administrators

Openx has support for platform admins who can perform functions like

* Seeing all users on the platform
* Manually enabling KYC for a user
* Banning a user
* Sending emails to users
* Create new platform registration codes

Openx admins are trusted entities who are in charge of the openx project's design and development. Platform admins should be those having access to the server where the platform's contract runs. However, admins do not have access to user accounts and can not perform functions like resetting passwords or investing in projects.
