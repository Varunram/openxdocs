# Platforms

Platforms in openx refer to platforms that build on top of openx and enable investments in a specific asset class. Opensolar is an example of a platform \(Opensolar enables investments in solar energy projects\) built on openx.

Platforms are independent entities that do not affect the base openx platform. Users having an openx account can simultaneously invest in multiple platforms if they have funds in the required currencies. Users on a platform can choose to be any entity as defined by the constructs of the platform. These roles are not reflected on openx.

Platforms building on openx need to be registered and need to obtain a unique code that enables them to use the platform-platform openx API. This API grants access to a privileged set of endpoints and allows platforms to create new openx users, retrieve data related to openx users, get openx constants and more.
