# Stablecoins

Stablecoins are representations of fiat currencies on blockchains. Common examples are Tether and USDCoin. Popular stablecoins are built on Bitcoin and Ethereum but since openx uses Stellar, Openx uses a stablecoin called "USD", a 1:1 representation of the US Dollar provided by AnchorUSD.

USD is an "asset" on Stellar whose issuer is AnchorUSD. If a user wishes to buy USD, they must undergo a series of checks and satisfy requirements placed by AnchorUSD and transfer money to AnchorUSD's bank accounts. In return, they would receive USD in their account. Users can also purchase USD using the Stellar DEX by exchanging XLM or other assets. USD can be used on Openx platforms that use Stellar and advertise for investments in USD.
