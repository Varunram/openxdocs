# Users

Users can undertake multiple roles in an openx-powered platform:

* Investors
* Recipents,

and more depending on a platform's utility. Openx leaves the requirements for these roles to the builders of a platform.

Users in openx can be of two types:

* **Individual accounts:** Individual aaccounts are held and represented by one individual.
* **Company accounts:** Company accounts are held by one individual but the account represents a company. KYC requirements for a company account differs from that of an individual account.

More types can be defined in the future if required \(platforms can define more types as well\)
