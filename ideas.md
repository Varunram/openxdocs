# Ideas

There are multiple ideas that seek to improve the functionality, security and usability of the platform. This doc does not seek to offer alternatives to Stellar. Rather, this doc assumes that the base blockchain layer is the same as is now, and seeks to suggest changes on top.

* Implementing a Content Management System \(CMS\) on the frontend: Opensolar requires a content management system in order to manage the content on the frontend. The frontend content is divided into the following sub categories:
  * Project content: Project details and content need to be editable by originators and receivers. Currently, this is done by changing parameters through the backend but this needs to be moved to the frontend where people can change content as desired.
  * Developer engine: The developer engine is one of the core pieces of the Opensolar platform. The engine enables developers to specify project details, give proejct quotes and continuously manage infrastructure all from one place.
  * Investor dashboard: The fields that are displayed on the investor dashboard are fed from a rudimentary CMS fed from the backend. These fields must be editable on the frontend by an investor, and an investor must have the optino to add fields from the backend to their dashboards.
  * Receiver dashboard: Like the investor dashboard, the fields that are displayed on the receiver dashboard are fed from a rudimentary CMS fed from the backend. These fields must be editable on the frontend.
  * Admin dashboard: Opensolar has an admin API interface through which admins can perform a variety of functions on the platform. These functions do not have pages on the frontend yet, and designing and developing such a page would be useful for all platform admins.
  * Teller dashboard: The teller works in conjunction with the platform, and there is no representation of the data that the teller communicates on the frontend. Designing such a page would be useful for developers and receivers to monitor progress on the teller, and view blockchain commitments and state updates that the teller commits.
* Pausable smart contracts: The Opensolar smart contract deployed on AWS has multiple redundancy checks in place but in no event can a platform admin stop its execution once the project flow is in place. Having a pausable smart contract would help admins arbitrate better in case of conflict and pause contract exeution in the event there's a hack on the platform, etc. This also helps clear some uncertainties on the legal side since the contracts can now be paused and investors can be protected by the platform against massive losses.
* Manually triggered smart contracts: Contrary to pausable smart contracts, a manually trigerred smart contract is when a platform admin can immediately move a project to stage 4 for investment, or to stage 5 after post-investment to start the teller workflow, etc. These are useful in cases when the automatic flow breaks down, or is insufficient to automatically upgrade project stages. For some stage transitions like stage 7-8, this is very useful since admins can review stage data and  transition stages.
* Migrating to a SQL based database: Opensolar right now uses boltDB - a key value pair database with limited room for scalability. Migrating to a SQL based database would better create relations between different entities on the platform, better design the database infrastructure, and be more scalable since SQL is designed to be used in production environments. postgreSQL or MySQL would be ideal options to look at for migration.
* Create a new project diagram: The project diagram on the opensolar readme is outdated and does not reflect many of the changes that have since taken place wrt  platform architecture. An updated diagram should also reflect the different entities on the platform, different stages associated, and more.
* Create an end project state: Projects on Opensolar do not have an end state right now but it is important to retire projects once they reach stage 8/9 and display the relevant data to investors and recipients on their dashboards. This state also helps keep track of how many projects have reached completion, and this could be displayed in a separate screen similar to the Explore Tab.
* Create your own smart contract function: Right now, the platform uses a predefined smart contract. Having a web based interface for originators and receivers to tweak parameters and create their own smart contract enables them to come up with new ideas that existing contract creators may not encounter. This also enables them to come up with conditions and parameters that may be relevant  only towards that project.
* Data visualization on the frontend: Though multiple data points are available, data is still displayed in a text format on the frontend. Having interactive graphs and would enhance the visual feel of the platform, and reduces time for investors to comb through data displayed.
* Legal contract templates: Projects on Opensolar requrie legal contracts to be stored on IPFS, and their hashes are stored on the "Stage Data" field associated with each stage of a project. Having templates for legal contracts on the frontend \(eg. a docusign iframe\) would make this process easier, and the platform can store the relevant data without much user intervention.
* Integration tests: The platform has unit tests for different modules but there are no integrations tests which can test different functionality that requires intervention. Having integration tests also helps identify when things break, and it is easier not to merge changes when these occur.
* Emulator as a full fledged web interface replacement: The emulator emulates certain functionality of the platform but does not act as a complete replacement to the web interface. Functionality on the emulator should be expanded so users who don't wish to trust a web interface can still interact and perform functions wihtin the platform.
* Alternate implementations on other blockchains: Opensolar is built on Stellar right now but there are proposals for building Opensolar on an alternate blockchain ecosystem. This can be done in parallel to Opensolar as is to compare both platforms simultaneously.
* Other language ports: Opensolar and Openx are written in Go but it would be nice to have Javascript or Python ports so people can easily incorporate functionality into their applications.
* Have two blockchain architectures in parallel: Along with Stellar, it would be nice to have another layer which supports on chain smart contracts and verification that can occur parallel to assets and financial payments on Stellar.
* Add secondary market: The platform can make use of the Stellar DEX to offer a secondary market to investors who can exchange one type of project assets for the other. Recipients could also potentially transfer DebtAssets to other holders in exchange for short term collateral.
* Private investments: Some investors might not want to reveal their investment amounts. . A potential mechanism to do this would be to transact multiple times between the investor and platform, and the net sum of all these transactions would be the investor's investment in the project. Private transactions could also happen on another chain, or potential layer 2 solutions.
* Sidechain implementations on Stellar: There are ideas for Sidechain implementations in Stellar. Having sidechains would help offload some transactions and state updates to the sidechain and would be similar to Bitcoin sidechains described in the alternatives doc.
* Desktop and Mobile Apps: The platform could have desktop and mobile apps that communicate with the backend and seek to serve critical functions \(like checking balance, monitoring payback, etc\). These apps reduce trust placed in the platform, since they are user run.
* Run own stellar core and horizon instances: Opensolar right now uses services run by the Stellar Development Foundation for interacting with the blockchain. We must run our own nodes to simplify this process and make things easier.
* Direct stablecoin investments: Currently, the platform can only do stablecoin investments in projects. Having XLM investments in projects is easy if the project's threshold is in XLM. Having investments in other assets on Stellar is also possible.
* Pilots with other ideas: Currently, Opensolar is only targeted at solar energy projects. An alternate pilot with something like decentralized housing, or something similar would help expand the horizons of the platform.
